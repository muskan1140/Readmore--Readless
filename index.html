                My encounter with the subject of Software Engineering was largely a positive experience and this encompasses 
                both the academic aspect as well as the non-academic areas touching on the students in the class and the overall 
                connections I established with them on human level. However, the following comprise of the key areas that summarize 
                what I consider to be the essential elements in engaging with the subject.
                <span class="read-more-text">
                  What we mean by software engineering and why it Is so critical? Software Engineering is concerned with employing principals of Engineering in general, and also 
                  making use of the directives of agreed ethics documented in order to produce reliable software that assists the endeavors
                  of society for the betterment of their lives.To achieve such goals, the production of software that delivers the required functionality
                  is the essence of the argument for it collectively brings together a team of professionals supporting the professional software
                  development.If the software principles had been adopted in that classic case, patients would not have been killed by Therac-25 system.
                   In the context of the question itself, there is a correlation between the theoretical material of the subject and the observations one has to make 
                   in dealing with the development of appropriate solutions to mitigate aspects of our lives.To a large extent one must find ways to overcome obstacles
                  to the progression of producing real solutions applicable to our desired goals, and in the long protracted process of doing so, it becomes essential to see,
                  observe, learn and live by the experience. This is the main pre-occupation I have with Software Engineering in its multi-facets, for it embodies the experience of 
                  many professional software developers seeking a common solution to a common problem.I can recall using some of the principles of Software Engineering in adopting a particular
                  given solution solely to enrich it till such a stage of perfection is reached. Consider the use-case diagram exercises. Even though there are multiple interpretations open to
                  choosing a particular path of producing a certain prototype, yet, it opens to a room for adding new or removing existing unwanted features, this itself is what life entails in
                  the pursuit of the perfect solution. A theory is only applicable for adoption if it can be used in the real world, otherwise it dies.There are extensive
                  theories open for exploration in Software Engineering,and given that the core of it all is about Software Development, we expect in most cases to have a practical 
                  understanding in the sense that abstract theories are brought to life through the construction and implementation of its own dictates such that it mimics the intended functionality.
